## Running the Server

In the project directory, you can run:

```bash
python app.py
```

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open <http://localhost:5000> to view it in your browser.

## Missing Modules

Since the app uses a specific version of certain modules, it is highly recommended to create a virtual environment and then install the modules from requirements.txt

```bash
python -m virtualenv venv
venv/scripts/activate
```

Install modules from requirements.txt using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
